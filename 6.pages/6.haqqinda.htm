    <h2>Film industry</h2>
    <p>
        The film and television industry supports a dynamic U.S. creative economy, employing people
            in every state, and across a diversity of skills and trades.
    </p>
    <p>
        In all, 2.74 million people—from special effects technicians to makeup artists to writers to
            set builders to ticket takers and more—work in jobs supported by the industry, which pays over $242 billion
            in wages annually. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When a movie or television show shoots on location, it brings jobs, revenue, and related
            infrastructure development, providing an immediate boost to the local economy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Our industry pays out $33 billion per year to more than 240,000 businesses in cities and
            small towns across the country—and the industry itself is comprised of more than 122,000 businesses, 92
            percent of which employ fewer than 10 people. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As much as $1.3 million can be injected into local economies per day when a film shoots on
            location. In some cases, popular films and television shows can also boost tourism.
